# tdschiabuffer
Python script for checking multiple source drives and moving files to destination drives. (Ubuntu/Linux)

Edit variables, run script as sudo, enjoy. ((sudo python3 tdschiabuffer.py))

This is my first script, credits to WolfRage76 for building a similiar script, and motivating me to learn how to make my own.
I was constantly mistyping drives, and would find the error later, so I tried to stupid proof the process for myself.
Checks all sources/destinations for access writes and space, moves files from sources to destinations.
Thank you, TheDarkShaman. You can reach me in the Chia/Swar discords for comment/question.
